            My project is aimed at awareness creation to the
            perpetrators of climate injustices, the project
            goes forward to show people how they can come
            to the fight of climate action even at the lowest
            levels.

            From the smallest of not littering, proper waste
            disposal to increased awareness and uptake of
            other forms of energy for day-to-day living like
            cooking.
            I aim to call out my friends who litter and walk on
            the lawns, i bring awareness on environmental
            sustainable energy alternatives to my family, so
            that they don't cook with charcoal and firewood
            but use electricity.
            I ask people to carry a shopping bag to the
            supermarket so that they are not given more
            polyethene bags.

            train and support recycling ventures.

            I look at what is done globally, the work
            strategies and I implement them to my friends,
            my family, my club and university.
